### A tiny introduction

Hi there ! I'm a student interested in graphics engine and programming language theory. I'm currently developping [here]() a raytracing engine in Python with matplotlib inspired by Evan Wallace's [work](https://madebyevan.com/webgl-path-tracing/) and Peter Shirley's "[Ray tracing in one week-end](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)".  
I'm currently learning [Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/about/) which is a functional programming language like Coq that aim to formalize mathematics. I'm using it as a theorem prover and hope to contribute in the near future ! As a challenge im formalizing the concept of a [Median Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_algebra).
